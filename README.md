# serverless-deployment-background-music
Oi! Bored while deployin'? Serverless taking too long? Your net is shit? Then this plugin is for you! It plays elevator music in the background while deploying :)
It streams the audio from [this](https://youtu.be/VBlFHuCzPgY) video, so your net can be the shittiest of 'em all :)

### Requirements
* you need to have [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed!
* install ytdl globally: `npm install -g ytdl`
