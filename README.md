# serverless-deployment-background-music
Oi! Bored while deployin'? Serverless taking too long? Your net is shit? Then this plugin is for you! It plays elevator music in the background while deploying :)
It streams the audio from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P2_w8fAu4c) video, so your net can be the shittiest of 'em all :)

### Requirements
* you need to have ffmpeg installed!
